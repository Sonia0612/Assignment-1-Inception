Qn2. Diff btw Lib & framework
- A programmer can call the library when & where he needs it.
  library targets a specific functionality.
  it can work on existing applications.
- framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.
  when using framework- the flow is controlled by the framework itself. 
  It gives you various locations to plug in your code, but it only calls the code you've plugged in when it's needed.
  
Qn3. What is CDN? WHy do we use It?
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a service used to accelerate the whole site delivery and itâ€™s static and dynamic content, large file downloads, and video streaming from your server.
- use:
  The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way
  A CDN improves efficiency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website server. 
  These CDN servers manage some of the client-server communications.
  They decrease web traffic to the web server, reduce bandwidth consumption, and improve the user experience of your applications.
  ReactJs CDN is a popular CDN available on React Ecosystem, which allows you to get all the features of ReactJs in your project.
  
Qn4. Why is React known As React?
- It was developed by Facebook(a site that CONSTANTLY updates their data) to improve the user interface development and 
  more effectively change (REACT to) what the user sees when they're doing things like mouse clicking, submitting and typing.
  
Qn5. WHat is Cross-Origin in the Script Tag?
- The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers.
  Here is where CORS comes in. 
  A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
  
Qn6. Diff btw React and ReactDOM
- React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM. 
  ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM

Qn7. Diff btw React production.js files and developement.js files in CDN
- The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and often times hot reloading ability in those builds. 
- The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which means this is the code running on your client's machine.

Qn8. What are async and defer?
- Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. 
- Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading
